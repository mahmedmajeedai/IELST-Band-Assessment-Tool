# IELST-Band-Assessment-Tool
 With the high social development and increasing worldwide relationships, English has
 become the most widely used language. A large amount of global knowledge and schol
arly content is written in English. Proficiency in English has now become an integral re
quirement for students who wish to pursue bachelor’s, master’s, or even PhD programs
 in European, British, Canadian, American, and even in Middle Eastern universities.
 Many institutes require the IELTS examination, which is widely acknowledged as a
 measure of English proficiency. Although the IELTS exam is becoming more and more
 important, many students remain unsuccessful in obtaining the required band score.
 However, there are no free tools available that let students take a complete mock IELTS
 test and get their band assessment. This makes it difficult for them to know if they are
 really ready for the test. So, students do not know if they need to study more or which
 parts they need to improve. Many students find this upsetting, and it may cause them
 to postpone their intentions to study overseas. There are many AI tools out there,
 but none that help with IELTS band assessment. We want to use Generative AI and
 Natural Language Processing techniques to create a tool that helps students check their
 own skills and know where they stand
