At its core, the immune system comprises two primary components: the innate and adaptive immune responses. The innate immune system acts as the first line of defense, utilizing physical barriers like skin and mucous membranes, along with various cells and proteins that recognize and attack invaders indiscriminately. The adaptive immune system, in contrast, provides a highly specific response to pathogens, involving lymphocytes like B cells and T cells. B cells produce antibodies that target specific antigens, while T cells can directly kill infected cells or help orchestrate other aspects of the immune response. This dual approach allows the immune system to mount both immediate and long-lasting defenses against infections. Memory cells, a feature of the adaptive immune system, retain information about previous encounters with pathogens, enabling a faster and more robust response upon subsequent exposures. This sophisticated interplay of innate and adaptive mechanisms is crucial for maintaining health and defending against the myriad of microbial threats we face daily."

Evolution explains the diversity of life on Earth, driven by the gradual accumulation of genetic variations that confer adaptive advantages. These variations arise from mutations, genetic recombination, and other mechanisms, and are acted upon by natural selection. Individuals with traits that enhance survival and reproduction are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation, leading to the evolution of populations over time. This process has led to the incredible diversity of life forms, from microorganisms to complex multicellular organisms. Fossil records, comparative anatomy, and molecular biology provide robust evidence supporting evolutionary theory, while ongoing research continues to uncover the intricate details of evolutionary pathways."

It consists of interphase, during which the cell grows and duplicates its DNA, and mitotic phase (M phase), where the cell divides into two daughter cells. Interphase is subdivided into G1 (cell growth), S (DNA synthesis), and G2 (preparation for mitosis). Mitosis itself is divided into prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis, which physically separates the cytoplasmic contents. Regulation of the cell cycle is critical, with checkpoints ensuring that each phase is completed accurately. Dysregulation can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer.
